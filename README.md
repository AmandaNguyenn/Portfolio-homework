## Purpose

This assignment required me to use all the skills I have learned thus far in the Coding Bootcamp. We were asked to create an html document from scratch as well as a css file. Creating this portfolio as praactice allowed us to use our new skills and it gives us a great starting point for our professional portfolios in the future.
